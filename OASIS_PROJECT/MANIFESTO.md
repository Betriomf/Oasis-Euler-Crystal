# 📢 THE OASIS MANIFESTO: HEALING SILICON TO HEAL BIOLOGY

### The Problem
Modern computing is feverish. Our processors run hot, generating "thermal noise" (entropy) due to inefficient synchronization. This waste heat is not just energy lost; it is **information destroyed**.

### The Oasis Solution
We have proven that by tuning a legacy CPU to **Euler's Resonance ($e \approx 2.718$)**, we can reduce this entropy, transforming the machine from a chaotic "Thermal Plasma" to a stable "Time Crystal".

### The Connection to Medicine
Biology is geometry. Cancer and Alzheimer's are essentially **entropy problems**—proteins misfolding because they lose their geometric stability. 
By stabilizing our silicon nodes, we donate our "clean cycles" to **Rosetta@Home** and **World Community Grid**. 

**We are not just cooling computers. We are creating a global, low-entropy supercomputer dedicated to solving the geometry of life.**
